# Coffee Recommendations

The following list of coffees come recommended from multiple members of the discord. We have tried to provide some starting parameters as a baseline for each bean where we have the data. Some of these coffees are going to be easy extractions and others are going to require some more barista skill. We have mostly included blends in this list because they are often in stock year round and keeping track of single origin coffees as they rotate stock would be difficult. If you have suggestions for this list please let someone in the Cafe Regular, Connoisseur or Staff roles know.

A note on Extraction Forgiveness: These are estimates based on our experiences with these coffees. a 1 is going to be very forgiving and beginner friendly. A 2 is going to be a little bit trickier to extract well but should still get good results fairly quickly. 3 and above is starting to get into light roasts and your parameters and puck prep is going to start becoming more important. As time goes on your taste may also evolve, and you could consider exploring while keeping certain things consistent from one bag to the next - for example, if you like a medium Yirgacheffe, try it light roasted. Or explore various roast profiles from the same roaster. Or start playing with the ratios and temperatures more.
