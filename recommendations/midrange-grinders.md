# Midrange Grinders
Welcome to the Midrange Grinder List! This is where the word "diminishing returns" starts getting thrown around a lot. For many people, especially those who prefer medium or medium-dark roasts, you will not find significant improvements in taste by upgrading your grinder from here. Light-roasts are another story, but we'll get to that later.

Depending on the user's propensity to modify, tinker, and align, grind quality will be either approximately the same, or at least be good enough to be served at a reputable  cafe. In this list, I will be differentiating between "Designed for Home" and "Commercial" options. Commercial grinders are meant to serve a completely different use-case compared to home-grinders, so they will often retain coffee, require modding, and be large and noisy. However, commercial grinders can be found on the used-market for cheap, so they can offer great value. Whether a specifically designed home grinder is worth the extra cost over a used commercial grinder is up to your personal values.

## A few Definitions/Notes

### Burr Measurements and Geometry
Flat Burrs and conical burrs are both measured via their outer diameter, so comparing burr sizes between them is not a useful endeavor. The usefulness of large burrs for a home application comes down to available grinding surface-area, which depending on the geometry, will lead to improved taste. In addition, there has been much conjecture about the taste of a flat vs a conical burr. This is an oversimplification; both flat and conical burrs are designed with a huge variety of geometries and cannot be generalized into a singular taste profile.

### SSP Burr Swaps
SSP is a Korean company that designs and machines high-end burrs. They are contracted by companies such as Kafatek, Weber-Workshops, and Option-O to design burrs for their grinders. SSP creates burrs which can be swapped into old commercial grinders, which can greatly improve the grind quality. [Website](http://www.sspgrind.com/sub/product/product.php).

To buy, find them at [espressotool](http://www.espressotool.com/?idx=3) or contact them directly.

### Grind distributions
If you hang around on the server or on forums, you will often see the words "bi-modal" and "unimodal" being thrown around. These are in reference to the grind distributions the grinder/burr combination creates. Bimodal refers to the plot having 2 "humps", centered around "fines" and "target grind-size" particles. Unimodal refers to the particles creating few fines and being centered around the target grind size.

Please note; this is an oversimplification. All grinders create fines, although some will create less than others, thereby being closer to unimodal. We can also note that the width of peaks can change from burr to burr. As for effects on taste, this is a bit of a black-box function, but what I can safely say is that you can make good coffee with any roast on either type of distribution, they will just taste different and you have to decide which flavor profile you prefer.

### Alignment
The two disks in a flat burr grinder should be as close to parallel as possible, in order to create the most even distribution it can while grinding. A surprising number of grinder are not well-aligned, and part of the reason why bespoke grinders are so expensive is because the manufacturing tolerances necessary to ensure alignment is very difficult to mass-produce economically.

As an example, see the EK43. While there are complaints of its alignment, also consider that aligning a 98mm burr requires lessthan 10um tolerance on the burr carrier, and then think about how many EK43s they sell to cafes and what its original purpose was (grinding spices). Aligning conicals is rarely done non-professionally, as they are much harder to align since they have no reference point to align from.

Note: there are a few avenues if you want to align your own grinder. If you have a Baratza Vario or Forte, you can align using the Alicorn method by Jake on HomeBarista. If you have different flat burr grinder, you can use the sandpaper method specified [here](https://www.scottrao.com/blog/2019/1/9/a-more-effective-way-to-align-your-grinder).

# Grinders Designed for Home

### Niche Zero: $663 from Indiegogo
- 63mm Mazzer Kony Conical Burr  
- Stepless  
- Single-dose
- "Polarizing" looks  

**Pros:** Switchable from brew to espresso, single dose, great espresso grind quality, decent brew grind quality, small, quiet, 58mm dosing cup  
**Cons:** slower grind speed, some don't like Mazzer Kony taste profile (somewhat bimodal), sells out quick like Yeezys

### Eureka Mignon Specialita $415 from Espresso Coffee Shop
- 55mm Eureka Flat Burr  
- Stepless  
- ~2g retention  
- Electric timer dosing  

**Pros:** good grind quality, precise dosing, small, quiet, fast, available in many places

**Cons:** not easily switchable for brew, not amazing for single-dosing, reported channeling issues until post-seasoning (it gets better with time)

### Baratza Forte $715 from Baratza Refurb
- 54mm Mahlkonig Ceramic Espresso burr OR 54mm Ditting Steel Brew Burr  
- Stepped  
- ~2g retention  

**Pros:** meant for light duty commercial use while having a small footprint, exceptional grind quality *when aligned*, grind by weight option

**Cons:** Grind quality is *okay* if left unaligned, somewhat loud, steel burrs are painfully slow

### Baratza Sette 270Wi $549 from Baratza **New**
- 40mm Etzinger Conical Burr
- Grind by weight
- Microstepped
- ~1g retention

**Pros:** Fast af, good grind quality, precise timer, doesn't popcorn much, stupid-easy workflow  
**Cons:** Gearbox issues, ear-destroyer, shims needed over lifespan

# Commercial Grinders
Differences between the grinders of the same burr size would be down to alignment or burr-quality. These usually don't grind as well as the modern home grinders, since R&D money has gone into designing for reliability and speed. However, these grinders come alive with a bit of modding. With alignment and a set of SSP burrs, this is as good as it gets before you spend on a titan.

## 64mm Commercials

### Mazzer Super Jolly: anything <$350 is a decent used price
- *Everywhere*  
- Old-fashioned

- [Doserless Mod](https://home-doserless.com/product/mazzer-super-jolly/)
- Bellows Mod (ask Discord members about this one; it can be done in different ways)  

**Pros:** Active modding community, absolute tanks, almost always worth saving, can be had as low as $20 (I'm serious)  
**Cons:** Usually has doser, absolute unit, lose calibration with burr cleaning, horrible single-dosing workflow, loud   
**Comparable Grinders:** Fiorenzato F4E, Anfim Caimano, Ceado e37j, Ceado E6P, Compak k6, Mazzer Mini Doserless (beware of motor), ECM S-Manuale 64, Nuova Simonelli MDX, Eureka Atom, Helios, Zenith 65 (buy SSP at your own risk: they may  or may not fit)
