# Recommended Accessories

The following is a list of things that are either required or good to have as you plan for your first espresso machine purchase.

## Cleaning:
* Microfiber towels
    * Wiping the machine down
* Brushes (various sizes):
    * Grinder cleaning
    * Countertop cleaning
* Grouphead cleaning
    * Pallo Coffee Tool
    * Espazzola group cleaning tool

## Cleaning Supplies:
* Cafiza
    * Used for back flushing once a month
* Rinsa
    * Deep cleaning the steam wand

## Puck Prep:
* WDT Tool
    * Used for stirring the groups in the PF to distribute well
    * Can be made from a cork and some 3d printer needles
* Dosing Funnel:
    * Helps keep the grounds contained while doing WDT
    * Get one that rests on the rim/outside of the basket/filter to avoid disturbing the grinds
* Scale that fits on the machine
    * Weigh your beans before brew
    * Weight your output as you are pouring
    * One with a timer is useful if the machine does not have one.
        * Note: time of shot is good for ballpark information but should be dialed in based on taste not time.
* Tamping Mat
    * Protect your counter tops

## Water Softening
* Protect your investment with good water. There are a few options that can be done here
    * Filtration (do not use Brita/Pur as they do not soften the water):
        * Peak water filters
        * ZeroWater Filters
    * Bottled:
        * RO
        * Distilled
* You will need to add some buffer minerals back into the above waters
* Homebrew mineral mix
        * Third wave water
        * There are some bottled water that can be used without needing to add buffer minerals back in: [https://home.lamarzoccousa.com/water-for-home-espresso/](https://home.lamarzoccousa.com/water-for-home-espresso)

## E-61 Specific:
* Molykote 111
    * Used to lubricate the camshaft after a cafiza backflush
* Big adjustable wrenches
    * Group head maintenance
    * Consider rubber coated wrenches to avoid scratching things
* Group Head thermometer
    * Reads the temperature of the water about 1.25" above the puck.
    * Very useful with a Heat Exchanger style machine unless the machine has a PID that is reading the group head temp instead of the boiler temp with its PID.
    * This is a mutually exclusive upgrade with the Flow Control Device
* Smart Plug/Timer
    * E61 machines can be safely put on a smartplug/timer since they have an auto fill sensor for the boiler.
    * Make sure you buy one that is rated for 15A.
    * Please do research about your machine and safety of doing this. The machine needs to have an auto fill circuit for the boiler.
* Flow Control Device:
    * Gain better control over your shots with flow profiling.
    * This is a mutually exclusive upgrade that competes with the Group Head thermometer.

## Milk Drinks
* Thermometer with clip to attach to pitcher
    * Measure milk temp as steaming
* Steaming Pitcher
    * Pitcher will hold about half the milk as the volume of the pitcher to account for space for vortex + expansion
    * Multiple sizes can be useful if you do various sizes of drinks. While you can steam smaller quantities of milk in a larger pitcher, it is often more dificult to do so.
    * Sizes start at 150ml (great for cortado/flat white) and get larger from there.
        * Some machines may have a hard time with larger quantites of milk.
* Steam Wand Tips
    * Some steam wands will have replaceable tips to adjust flow rates of steam.

## Nice to haves:
* Knockbox
    * Easy place for grounds disposal if you are not near a trash can.
    * Don’t run coffee grounds down your sink/garbage disposal
* Self leveling precision tamper
    * Ensures a good consistent & level tamp

        * Least Expensive
        * Most options on sizes
    * Decent
    * Kafatek LevTamp
        * Not often in stock. Will sell out within a few minutes of going on sale
* Brix Refractometer
    * For Science!
    * 20% brix refractometer is good for calculating your extraction yield if you really want to fall down the rabbit hole.
* Bottomless portafilter
    * Helps diagnose problems with puck prep
* Shot mirror
    * Paired with the bottomless portafilter so you don’t have to contort your body to look at things
