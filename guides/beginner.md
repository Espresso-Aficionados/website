# How to Dial In Espresso: The Basics

When dialling in an espresso shot, there are three main variables that you can adjust to affect the taste of your espresso.
- Dose a.k.a. grams of coffee in
- Brew ratio a.k.a dose in:espresso out. For example, 40g of espresso extracted from 20g of dry grounds is often expressed as a brew ratio of 1:2
- Grind size

### 1. Lock in your dose
Choose a dose that best suits your basket. Underdosing can lead to a soupy puck (though this is not always an indication of a bad shot), while overdosing can cause your puck to contact the shower screen, leading to uneven flow of water through the puck.

Also note that higher doses of coffee are harder to properly extract, as there is more coffee to extract fully. This is especially true for lighter roasts. If you find yourself struggling to extract enough, and your shots are tasting sour despite pulling a longer ratio, try dosing 1-2g less.

_For the sake of this example, lets say we are locking in a dose of 18g_

Note: While dose is a variable that can also be adjusted to affect shot time, for simplicity's sake, it is easier to lock in dose *first* and adjust shot time via changing grind size.

### 2. Quick grind size adjustment
Once dose is locked in, adjust your grind size so that your shot parameters fall in the ballpark of a 1:2 ratio shot taking 25-30s.
Don't agonize over this too much, we will refine our grind size later.

### 3. Adjust brew ratio to taste
Once your shot is pulling in the ballpark of 20-35s, we can now adjust brew ratio according to what the shot tastes like.

A 1:2 brew ratio with a 18g dose would give us a yield of 36g espresso out.

Is the shot tasting too sour? Increase your brew ratio and try pulling 18g/40g, or even 18/44g

Is the shot tasting too bitter? Shorten the ratio and instead try 18g/32g

If your shot is tasting both bitter and sour at the same time, you’re probably extracting unevenly due to channeling - work on your puck prep!

_Lets say that a brew ratio of 18g/40g is giving us the most balanced tasting shot, with balanced acidity, gentle sweetness, and no astringency_

### 4. Hone in on your grind
Once you’ve found the ratio that works best, we want to work on increasing our extraction.
A finer grind will generally increase flavor complexity as well as increase body and texture of the shot. Grinding finer increases the surface area of your grinds, allowing more coffee to be extracted.

As a general rule, you want to grind as fine as you can. At some point, your grind will be too fine, flow will decrease, extraction will diminish, and your shot will start tasting underextracted.

If you find that flavour starts to drop off, you’ve gone into ‘too fine’ territory. Grind one step coarser, and, as a general rule, that is most likely the best grind size for your current recipe.

_Congratulations, you've dialled in your shot!_

### Bonus round
Brew temperatures can play a big role in extraction, especially if you're brewing beans that are roasted very light or dark. Most beginner machines are set to 200F/93.5c, but for those of you with machines capable of temperature adjustment, this is another variable you can play with.

As a general rule, lower temperatures will extract *less* while higher temperatures will extract *more*.

### Help! My shot tastes bad no matter what I do!

If you find that the shot doesn’t taste good no matter what, it could be your beans, not you! Try cupping your beans to get an overall sense of flavour and an indication of what your shot could taste like. If your beans taste overly sour or bitter during your cupping, chances are you won't be able to get a shot that doesn't taste that way.
